â†’ 22 Common attack vectors to check while researching:

- Frontrunning/backrunning
- Using very small amounts as inputs (e.g. 1 wei)
- Passing zero as an input
- Using contracts that cannot accept ether
- Gas griefing with external calls
- Weird ERC20 tokens (fees, 777, return values, etc...)
- Price manipulation
- Blacklisted ERC20 addresses
- Potential overflow/underflow
- Block re-orgs
- Reentrancy (721, inter-function, inter-contract, inter-system (read-only))
- Sybil attacks on incentives/tokenomics
- Flash loans (even flash mints e.g. Dai)
- Accepting any data from an arbitrary address (Malicious bytes)
- Inflating internal accounting by sending tokens to the system
- Forced precision loss when precision really matters (min balance checks etc...)
- Addresses that might be empty at one point, yet house contract code at another

- Reverting (external calls I can make revert, inputs I can use to cause a revert)
- Unexpected addresses (provide a `receiver` address pointing to another contract in the system)
- Selector clashing
- Signatures (replay, malleability, recover to 0 address etc...)
- Hash collision (encodePacked)
